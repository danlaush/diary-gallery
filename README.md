Built with Preact and HTM. Works in modern browsers with no build step.

## Getting started

Use your favorite basic HTTP server from the root of the project, and you're good to go.

For extra credit, make sure all routes are served by `index.html`. Otherwise, sending the browser directly to URLs like `/diary` won't work.

```shell
diary-gallery$ npx http-server --proxy http://localhost:8080?
```
