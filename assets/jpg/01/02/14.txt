Sunday 1943
Frank and Fran got up for 8:00 Service at their church. Went to 9 Mass. After dinner we took some snaps then walked down to the Convent (via rink) to say good-bye to the rink. Had long talk with Fran on way home and one with Frankie here. Went to Vancouver to Helen's at about 4 o'clock. Had supper at Helen's. Took Frankie to the hotel at about 8 to meet her dad. I hated to leave her as did Fran. Met Dad at Nanaimo boat. He saw Vic last night Fran stayed here overnight because it was too late.

Monday 1944
Rained this AM and sort of sleet came down all day but it's very cold again tonight. Took lunch at Langley's. Had noon-hour Valentine dance. Bud wasn't there at all. Nuts! They played all our pieces. I nearly went nuts! Went to music lesson then to choir. We practised terribly hard tonight. Dad gave me my note to quit Latin. Oh happy day! Mr Taylor was here for supper.
