Thursday 1940
Went to meeting of RCHJA at Joyce Furness' house. Jean had operation Fround stone in her stomache. Joe to take exam tomorrow in music.

Monday 1943
Went to Vancouver again to-day. No bands yet. Got darling Valentine from Bob. Bought super birthday card for Fran. School was awful after that weekend. Missed Mr Wallace's because of Latin. Jo had a class reunion for Walter Mercer who goes into the Air Force tomorrow. All the kids were trying to help me with my Virgil. It's awful. Finally gave up and came to bed.

Tuesday 1944
Snowed nearly all day. Went over with Val and Delcie to see Sully who's in bed with rheumetism of the skin on her legs. She's much better now but was quite sick a few days ago. Val & I were pelted with snowballs coming home.
