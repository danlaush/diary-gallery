Thursday 1940
Had history test. It was awful. Ears don't bother me but hearing is a little hard. Stayed after school and covered all books. Worked in library from 4:00 to 5:00 Saw Sister's sister

Monday 1943
Got fed up with Sr M Agne as usual. I _can't stand_ that man! Studied Latin nearly all evening.

Tuesday 1944
Went downtown to take shoes to Pine's. Went up to Langley's with the kids after. Val also Fran came in before supper to hear the record of the choir. Mom & Dad went to Shaunessy for dinner. Went skating. Alex was there but very cool. Nuts! Walked home with Billy Leavis. Found out Jack and Mary were here tonight and Doreas is married. Gosh! I can't believe it! Broke my nail! Doggone!
